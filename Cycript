Cycript tricks

For Mac version


NSApplication.sharedApplication   [ will return instance of the application running]

NSapplication.sharedApplication.windows  [ wil return list of windows ]

NSApplication.sharedApplication.windows[0].title

IPHONE apps  here is the deal

UIApp [ instance of the application]

UIApp.windows [ will show windows of the app]


UIApp.windows[0].subviews[0]   [ for the subwindows in the application]

UIApp.window[0].subview[0].subview[0].... [ for all the subview in the application]



To get the methods of the particular class or Visible view 

<VIewcontrollerName>  -> isa.messages   or <viewcontrollrname>.messages [ will get all the methods of the particular controller]



Getting access to method or rewriting method

<viewcontrollername>.messages[‘<methodname>’] = function () { return “something”;} // rewriting function   [ this is how we write function ]

Another trick with delegate invoking method

[UIApp.delegate.<methodname]
